        <h1>Jacob County Estate Planning Attorney – Beneficiary Designations</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Reviewing and possibly changing your beneficiary designations is an important part of comprehensive estate
            planning.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h2>What is Meant by Beneficiary Designation?</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                Most accounts, life insurance and other financial products allow the owner to designate one or more
                beneficiaries who will receive the death benefit or the assets within the account on the death of the
                account owner. The beneficiary designation function is usually built into the account agreement with the
                financial institutions. If everything is set up correctly, the account or insurance policy benefit will
                transfer directly to the beneficiary without the need for probate. Depending on the account, the
                beneficiaries may be referred to as death beneficiaries, pay on death beneficiaries (POD), transfer on
                death beneficiaries (TOD), or other similar terms.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Is It Important to Review Beneficiary Designations as Part of Estate Planning?</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                Since ownership of the death benefit may move to the beneficiaries without the need for probate, the
                beneficiary designation may effectively override plans for a distribution through a Last Will and
                Testament or other estate planning. The beneficiary designations need to align with the entire plan of
                distribution.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                Beneficiary designations are sometimes overlooked in general and even sometimes not reviewed when the
                account is opened. For a longstanding account, there may be a lot of changes over time that would call
                for a change in the death beneficiaries. For example, in their 20s an employee may start a job featuring
                an employer-sponsored 401(k), as a single person, having no one else at the time, the employee may
                designate a parent or a sibling as the beneficiary. Later, the employee gets married and has children.
                Unless the employee reviews that beneficiary designation and changes it to the employee's spouse, the
                parent or sibling originally assigned as the death beneficiary will remain as the death beneficiary. At
                the death of the employee, ownership of the assets in that 401(k), which could be substantial, would
                most likely automatically pass to the parent or sibling even if the employee’s will left the employee’s
                entire estate to the employee’s spouse.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                Outside factors such as death or divorce may affect beneficiary designations.
